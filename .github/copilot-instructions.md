# GNUPlex codebase

## Code checks:

After writing code, confirm code builds successfully by running: `uv run make.py build`.

You can build just the backend by running `uv run make.py go_build`. You can build just the frontend by running `uv run make.py frontend_build`.

Confirm that format the code by running `uv run make.py fmt`.
